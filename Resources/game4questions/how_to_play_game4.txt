HOW TO PLAY: LABYRINTH OF LIES (GAME 4)
==========================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Welcome to the Labyrinth of Lies! This is a logic puzzle game where you must navigate through 10 rooms, each containing three doors. Your goal is to find the correct door in each room by analyzing the statements made by the doors and following the rules provided.

GAME MECHANICS
--------------
• You start with 2 minutes (120 seconds) on the timer
• You must complete all 10 rooms to win the game
• Each room has exactly ONE correct door
• Choose the wrong door and you'll be sent back to Room 1
• Complete a new room (one you haven't reached before) to gain 60 seconds of bonus time
• The timer runs continuously - it never pauses during transitions

SCORING SYSTEM
--------------
• Base Score: 10 points per room completed
• Time Bonus: 5 points for every 30 seconds remaining when you finish
• Maximum possible score: 100 points (10 rooms × 10) + time bonus
• Your highest score is automatically saved

HOW TO PLAY
-----------
1. Click "Play" to start the game
2. Read the NOTE on the wall - this tells you the rules for the current room
3. Read the statements on each door sign
4. Use logic to determine which door is telling the truth
5. Click on the door you think is correct
6. If correct: advance to the next room
7. If wrong: return to Room 1 and try again

ROOM RULES & DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION
----------------------------------
The game gets progressively harder as you advance:

ROOMS 1-2: BASIC RULES
• Room 1: All doors tell the truth
• Room 2: All doors lie

ROOMS 3-5: ONE LIAR
• One door lies, two doors tell the truth
• You must identify which door is lying

ROOMS 6-8: TWO LIARS  
• Two doors lie, one door tells the truth
• Only one door can be trusted

ROOM 9: MIXED SCENARIO
• One door lies, one tells the truth, one is unknown
• The correct door must be the truthful one
• Doors may accuse each other of lying/telling the truth

ROOM 10: FINAL CHALLENGE
• All doors are unknown (can lie or tell the truth)
• The correct door must be truthful
• Use cross-references between door statements

LOGIC STRATEGIES
----------------
1. START WITH THE NOTE: Always read the wall note first - it tells you the rules
2. IDENTIFY PATTERNS: Look for contradictions between door statements
3. USE ELIMINATION: If two doors contradict each other, one must be lying
4. CROSS-REFERENCE: When doors accuse each other, use this information
5. WORK BACKWARDS: Assume each door is correct and see if it violates the rules

EXAMPLE SOLVING PROCESS
------------------------
Room 1 Example:
• Note: "All doors tell the truth"
• Door 1: "I am the way forward"
• Door 2: "Left Door is the way forward" 
• Door 3: "Center Door is not the way forward"

Solution: Since all doors tell the truth, Door 1's statement "I am the way forward" must be true. Therefore, Door 1 is correct.

Room 2 Example:
• Note: "All doors lie"
• Door 1: "I am the way forward"
• Door 2: "Right Door is the way forward"
• Door 3: "Left Door is the way forward"

Solution: Since all doors lie, Door 1's statement "I am the way forward" is false. Therefore, Door 1 is NOT correct. If Door 2 says "Right Door is the way forward" and this is a lie, then Right Door is NOT correct. If Door 3 says "Left Door is the way forward" and this is a lie, then Left Door is NOT correct. This means Door 2 (Center Door) must be correct!

Room 3 Example (One Liar):
• Note: "One door lies, two tell the truth"
• Door 1: "Center Door is the way forward"
• Door 2: "I am the way forward"
• Door 3: "Left Door is lying"

Solution: If Door 3 is telling the truth that "Left Door is lying", then Door 1's statement is false. But if Door 1 is lying, then Center Door is NOT the way forward. If Door 2 is telling the truth that "I am the way forward", then Door 2 is correct. This works: Door 1 lies, Doors 2 and 3 tell the truth.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
----------------
• Take your time to read and understand each statement
• Don't rush - logic puzzles require careful thinking
• If you get stuck, try assuming each door is correct and see what happens
• Remember: the correct door must always be truthful (even in mixed scenarios)
• Use the timer bonus wisely - completing new rooms gives you more time
• Practice makes perfect - the logic patterns become clearer with experience

CONTROLS
--------
• Click on any door sign to select that door
• Use the "Quit" button to exit the game (no time bonus)
• "Play Again" to restart after finishing
• "Back to Menu" to return to the main menu

GOOD LUCK!
